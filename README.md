## Brief Introduction

I'm a seasoned IT administrator, currently head of IT for a well know UK construction outfit. I've 14 years construction industry experience and closing in on 25 years it the IT industry. My fascination with IT started and a very early age and my first introduction was via the ZX Spectrum. My job is my hobby. I'm a tinkerer, problem solver and a project manager. I manage a very small but efficient team supporting hundreds of users across multiple sites. Security, connectivity and resource availability are crucial to the industry. 

## Objective

I've found myself increasing concerned and fascinated with Cybersecurity, defending from the daily threats in my current role, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

I'm currently subscribed to Hack the Box as a VIP to upskill my knowledge and toolset.

The idea position would be on a counter offisive team activity persuing bad actors.

Currently that is limited to reporting mostly phishing attacks to authorities and sec company to disrupt and prevent others from falling victim to scams.
